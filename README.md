# Predictive Maintenance Dashboard Documentation

## Introduction
Welcome to the Predictive Maintenance Dashboard! This interactive application offers valuable insights for predictive maintenance of industrial machinery, helping you monitor and analyze equipment health. Built to simplify data visualization and prediction, it’s ideal for understanding equipment status, estimating remaining useful life (RUL), and detecting anomalies.

## Features
1. **Home:** Start here for a quick overview of the application.
2. **Historical Data:** View sensor readings, operational hours, and more for in-depth historical analysis.
3. **Input Data:** Easily submit data for predictions—manually or by generating random values.
4. **Results:** Get instant predictions for RUL, maintenance needs, and anomaly detection.
5. **Visualizations:** Explore data through histograms, scatter plots, line charts, and more. Optionally, overlay input data for easy comparison!
